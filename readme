This repository is based on the course project of 17700 - CMU. The Project is about a Large Scale ML pipleline based on Reddit Comment Corpus.
We tried predicting the Score and a self defined label of Viralness using the 'body' of a data point in the json body in the Reddit corpus.

This repository contains the code for the same.
